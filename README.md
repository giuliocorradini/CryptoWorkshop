### Euler's totient function
*a.k.a. phi function*

> The phi function of a given integer *n* counts the positive
> integers up to *n* that a coprime with *n*.

Two coprime numbers only share 1 as a common factor.


Let's give an example: 洧램(4) = ... 

4 is factored as 1 x 2 x 2; the numbers from 1 to 4 (n)
that are coprime with 4 (n) are 1 and 3.

[**1**, 2, **3**, 4], hence 洧램(4) = 2

#### Properties
1. *n* is prime => 洧램(n) = n - 1
2. a, b are coprimes => 洧램(a*b) = 洧램(a)*洧램(b)
3. N = p1 * p2 with p1, p2 primes => 洧램(N) = 洧램(p1)*洧램(p2)
= (p1-1)(p2-1)
    - Note that prime numbers are also coprimes with every other number.

#### Implementation
We offer a routine to compute Euler's totient for a given number.

The code is under `maths/totient.py`
